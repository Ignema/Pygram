## ðŸ“˜ Description

One of the most promising aspects of modern technology is the cloud nature
of how we build and deploy applications on a massive scale. The ecosystem
around this fact has grown exponentially in the last several years and itâ€™s especially interesting to consider the ways we study and conceive these systems
because their complexity grew with the numerous services that are shipped.

The used approach focuses on building a way to transform ideas into reality by
converting the code that generates diagrams into full fledged configuration files
that can build real life clusters and infrastructure using Jetbrains MPS.

This project was realized in the context of our model driven engineering class. You can check the report [here](https://github.com/Ignema/Pygram/blob/master/res/Report.pdf). Special thanks to our instructor professor **Mahmoud El Hamlaoui** for his guidance and tutoring.
